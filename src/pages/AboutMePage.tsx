              Hello, My name is Panji Hanum, u can call me Panji
              <br />I love programming since 2019 that for the first time I
              learn programming in BLK Bekasi and I learn Desktop Programming
              with C#. <br />
              For the next, I learn again about web programming in the test
              Bootcamp of Arkademy (now is PijarCamp) and I dont know I pass
              when I coding web for the first time. and when I bootcamp, I learn
              mobile programming with React Native and Adonis JS as a Backend.
              and it's really amazing. <br />
              And then when I got the job for the first time, u know ? I got
              Java Programming and it was the first time again in to learn Java
              guided by my best senior. And then I got "Rising Star Of the Year"
              because my management suppose I cannot follow the bussiness flow
              with Java because I dont have experience in Java, and in the 6
              months, I got the "Rising Star" that exceeded management
              expectations. <br />
